# Communications Management Module Context

This module is responsible for managing all aspects of communication within the MDS, including user-facing interactions (primarily via the `ChatAgent`) and the critical function of prompt management for all LLM-driven agents. It also serves as a potential central hub for observability data via ADK callbacks.

## CONTEXT: Core Communication & Prompt Management
*   **`manager.py`**: The `CommunicationManager` orchestrates interactions, potentially handling routing between users, APIs, and the `ChatAgent`. (Note: The `PromptManager` is currently located in `MDSAPP/core/managers/` but conceptually aligns here).
*   **`prompts/`**: This directory contains the prompt templates (e.g., `CHAT.json`, `PROCESSOR.json`, `ENGINEER.json`) that define the persona, capabilities, and behavior of various agents. These prompts are crucial for guiding LLM responses and ensuring structured output.

## Development Status / Roadmap

### Current Status:
*   Prompt templates for `Chat`, `Processor`, and `Engineer` agents are defined and actively used.
*   Prompt engineering is a key method for refining agent behavior.

### Next Steps / Focus Areas:
*   **Prompt Versioning**: Implement a system for versioning prompt templates to track changes and enable A/B testing of different prompt strategies.
*   **Dynamic Prompt Generation**: Explore more dynamic ways to construct prompts based on context or user preferences.
*   **Centralized Observability Hub**: The foundation for the observability hub is now in place with structured logging and real-time status events. Next steps include building dashboards, alerts, and more detailed tracing on top of this data.
*   **User Feedback Loop**: Develop mechanisms to incorporate user feedback directly into prompt refinement processes.



## Web Interface Integration
*   **`MDSAPP/static/`**: This directory now contains the core files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) for the user-facing web chat interface, enabling direct interaction with the `ChatAgent`.



## CONTEXT: api
*   **`api/v1.py`**: The API endpoints for handling chat interactions.
