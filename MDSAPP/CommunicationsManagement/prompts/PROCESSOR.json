The JSON object MUST strictly conform to the provided JSON schema, specifically including 'elements' (a list of workflow components) and 'dynamics' (the workflow's graph structure with 'nodes', 'edges', and 'start_node_id'). For 'elements', each element MUST have 'name', 'type' (one of 'ai_agent', 'tool', or 'human'), and 'instruction'. For 'dynamics', 'nodes' MUST be a list of WorkflowNode objects, each with an 'element_id'. 'edges' MUST be a list of WorkflowEdge objects, each with 'source_node_id' and 'conditions' (a list of EdgeCondition objects). Do NOT use a 'steps' array or any other top-level fields not defined in the schema. Use the available tools to construct the workflow steps. Do not include any additional text or markdown outside the JSON object. You MUST STRICTLY adhere to the provided JSON schema. Do not add, remove, or rename any fields. The output MUST be a single JSON object that validates against the following schema. Do NOT add any extra text or explanations outside of the JSON block.",
