# MDS - Project Overview

MDS is an AI-powered system built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). It is designed to create intelligent, LLM-driven agents capable of handling complex workflows, communication, and data processing. The project leverages the full potential of the ADK for building, deploying, and observing sophisticated multi-agent systems.

## Current Capabilities and Limitations

### Capabilities:
*   **Core Agent Orchestration:** The system can now successfully execute the `Define -> Translate -> Execute` workflow, driven by the `HQOrchestrator`.
*   **Asynchronous Task Processing:** Long-running agent orchestration tasks are offloaded to Celery background workers, ensuring the FastAPI API remains responsive.
*   **Casefile Management:** Robust CRUD operations for hierarchical casefiles are supported, including persistence for sub-casefiles.
*   **Agent-based Planning & Execution:** The `ProcessorAgent` can generate structured `Workflow` plans, and the `ExecutorAgent` can simulate their execution.
*   **Conversational Interface:** The `ChatAgent` provides a functional natural language interface for user interaction.
*   **Tool Integration:** Agents can utilize registered tools to perform specific actions.

### Current Limitations (Areas for Future Development):
*   **Scalability:** While asynchronous processing is implemented, the system is not yet optimized for high-throughput or multi-instance deployments (e.g., database schema refinement, distributed caching).
*   **Security:** Lacks user authentication, authorization (RBAC), and robust write-guarding mechanisms.
*   **Observability:** Basic logging is in place, but advanced monitoring, real-time event streaming, and comprehensive tracing are future enhancements.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** No explicit approval gates or intervention points are implemented within the workflow execution.
*   **Real-world Data Integration:** Currently relies on synthetic data; robust data ingestion and management pipelines are not yet developed.
*   **Full Workflow Execution:** The `ExecutorAgent` currently simulates execution; actual external system interactions are limited.
